description: I'm currently taking CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python course, here's my half way report.

I'm learning [**Python**](https://www.python.org) - a programming language - to build my technical skills. I choose Python because it's often considered one of the easier languages to learn and is a little more readable then `JavaScript` along with being multi-purpose. We also have Python in our tech stack at work.

I'm now half way through [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) course and wanted to share my thoughts so far.

## CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python

I was going to take [Replit's 100 Days of Code](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=100_days_of_code_python) but after completing [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Scratch](https://cs50.harvard.edu/scratch/2024/) course (I had already taken [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science for Business Professionals](https://cs50.harvard.edu/business/2017/) - highly recommended), I decided to jump into their Python course.

> [!Note]
> I didn't do the Scratch course problems / projects but I did create some of [my own](/scratch)

Comparing CS50 to other courses, the topics / modules seem to cover a greater scope of Python. Each module has a lecture lasting about an hour followed by *short* supporting videos. Crucially the course is designed for students with or **without** prior programming experience.

The course has problem sets that you can turn in to receive a certificate. It's not the same as a college course I guess where you *have* to turn in these problems but I'm making myself do them (unlike Scratch!). Pre-empting the section below, programming makes you **think**. There're about 5 problems for each module and the difficulty varies. For a total beginner like me they can be hard! You get some hints, but as this is a HarvardX course I think back to my Uni days where knowing the course material only got you so far... further reading required. Ultimately, for me doing is the best way to learn. I even recently found myself writing a budget calculator programme instead of using a spreadsheet!

I've just finished module 4 on Libraries which covers how to use Python to call an API and use the returned data - great for product managers to understand :snake:

> You need discipline to work through the problems, they're challenging for a newbie but doable in many different ways. You just have to get stuck in and do (or try :joy:), that repetition is what makes the knowledge stick.

### Why learn a programming language

### Programming makes you think

> *"Everybody in this country should learn how to programme a computer, because it teaches you how to think" - Steve Jobs*

Famous quote from Steve Jobs and I can now strongly emphasise with it, programming forces you to **think** logically. Your programme won't work or run as expected otherwise.

Right now, I'm still struggling to think logically to solve some of the course problems, but I'm improving with each module :smile:

### Programming makes you appreciate enabling technology

In Marty Cagan's product management *bible* **Inspired**, Marty talks about two critical classes for product managers.

1. Introduction to Computer Programming
2. Introduction to Business Accounting / Finance

Here's Marty's explanation from the book why we should learn programming:

> *"It will fundamentally expand your technology horizons and enable you to have richer discussions with your engineers and designers" - Marty Cagan, Inspired*

When the team did a recent show and tell, I was able to understand the validation flow we were discussing - it wasn't even Python - and what was going on in the code. In another show and tell reviewing a new AWS Lambda function, I was able to understand the majority of the code - this one was Python - and ask technical questions! All this after 5 modules of an Introduction to Programming course.

I'll be honest, growing up I didn't have an interest in programming. But after enjoying building this website, and gaining new appreciations, I'm enjoying learning to programme. Am I going to change careers to be a developer, no, but I see the value in how it can make me a better product manager, and *hobbyist* developer :man_technologist:

> [!Note]
> Marty talks about learning any programming language but not a markup language such as HTML. After building this website and learning some programming I get why. HTML doesn't really teach you how to think, you just need to get something written down a web browser can read - CSS then makes it pretty. Both are important to understand in their own context as many technology products have a user interface. A programming language takes it behind the scenes.

## Wrap up

That's my half way report into learning programming with Python. When I've finished the course I'll write a "part 2" and go into details on my final project.

If you're reading this and still aren't sure if you should learn a programming language, just do it, you've got nothing to lose and skills to gain!

Thanks for reading :call_me_hand:
