## My personal website

For my first *personal* foray into technology, why not start with a personal website. This site is open source, you can view the code at [kits-dna](https://github.com/makendon/kits-dna). The repository name was inspired by [crisp-dna](https://dna.crisp.se/docs/index.html), this site was the "a ha" moment that I could feasibly build my own website. Of course my site is an insight into *my* inner workings.

I'm going to use the sites blog to start writing my thoughts. *Thinking* and *writing* are two crucial non-technical skills that I want to grow with this project :thought_balloon:

### Building kits-dna

> :recycle: **Updated 02/03/2025**

I've migrated `kits-dna` from Jekyll and GitHub Pages to **Eleventy** and **Netlify**. See my post [Migrating from Jekyll to Eleventy](/migrating-from-jekyll-to-eleventy).

My site was hosted on GitHub Pages and built using **Jekyll**. I used the **Minima** theme, with custom `HTML` and `CSS`. I built the site entirely on my iPad Pro using **GitHub Codespaces**. You can still view my [Jekyll code](https://github.com/makendon/kits-dna/tree/jekyll) to help you get started.

The site logo is AI generated using **DALL.E**.

Check out my [blog](/blog) for more on building `kits-dna` if you're interested.

Building the site got me started with markup code, and design. Learning a programming language is my next challenge.
