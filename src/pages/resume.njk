  <summary><strong>Product Manager @ DWP | October 2022 - Present</strong></summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Led a multi-functional team of 10 to improve the GitLab Runner platform, operating within significant legacy infrastructure and organisation constraints. Championed a strategic re-platform, collaborating with the central hosting team. Proactively challenged resource constraints, and influenced stakeholders to propose solutions to unblock delivery. Implemented proactive monitoring and alerts to anticipate problems. This reduced incidents by 50% and achieved a 99.9% success rate.</li>
    <li>Led discovery of an AI Code Assistant, managing significant viability constraints and risks. Collaborated with vendor and commercials to ensure acceptable terms and conditions with no legal blockers. Produced a design authority governance pack and engaged with security risk, data protection and bias assessments. Paved the way for trial approval, with potential for multi-million pound return on investment and improved developer satisfaction.</li>
    <li>Delivered a secure authentication product from discovery to public beta, anticipating and mitigating risks across architecture, engineering and security. Facilitated design workshops with users to identify constraints, leading to agreed trade-offs. Prioritised problems using limited early data and user feedback, allowing a critical platform to onboard. This reduced engineering time by 75%, cut hosting costs by 15%, and improved deployment security.</li>
    <li>Took ownership of technical problems from investigation to fix implementation. Worked with engineers to investigate why jobs failed, conducted 5 why‚Äôs analysis and reviewed job logs. Identified potential fix, tested successfully in lower environments and pushed fix. Prevented early job termination, preventing manual clean-up.</li>
    <li>Developed product artefacts including a user centred product vision, product strategy aligned to departmental goals on which problems to solve, and a dynamic outcome-focused roadmap to guide teams and stakeholders on what we‚Äôre building to execute the strategy. Enabled focussed delivery, achieving the outcomes defined in our OKRs.</li>
    <li>Implemented Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to provide focus, and drive prioritisation decisions aligned to our strategy. Introduced forced priorities to maintain service excellence without derailing product development.</li>
    <li>Championed user feedback loops, and influenced senior stakeholders to pivot the vision and roadmap, enabling earlier value realisation and improved focus.</li>
    <li>Coached the product team - including engineers - in product discovery techniques and dual-track agile, building product capability to contribute earlier to discover effective solutions and improve team maturity.</li>
    <li>Mentored an associate product manager, provided coaching on product roadmaps, backlog management and prioritisation techniques.</li>
