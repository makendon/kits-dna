I’m married with a baby girl, and two cats, one or both might appear on this site at some point! We live in North-East England.

I grew up in the countryside, which inspired my masters degree in Geoscience. My Digital journey started with networking learnt working in Oil & Gas before moving into Financial Services where I supported Cyber Security engagements.

I moved into a product role in the public sector at the end of 2019 starting in Networking, before moving into Microsoft 365 and now within Platform Engineering and Developer Tooling. Our product/s are *internal* - our users are primarily engineers - and our mission is to improve their lives by providing them the tools they need to allow them to focus on solving citizen problems.

> :thinking: The purpose of my blog is to write my thoughts. Pretty simple, but thinking and writing are critical skills. If it can help me engage interests, be more creative and learn new skills then I'll be happy. In the future who knows I might start a focussed blog or newsletter.

## :mirror_ball: Fun

:soccer: Newcastle United! :raising_hand_man: was a hero of mine growing up.

:golf: I don't play or practice enough but there's something about the challenge of improving that I love.

:ski: Started skiing at 6 years old in Canada, also skied in Switzerland, Norway, France and Italy.

:video_game: I mainly play sport games, not played much since becoming a Dad and spending spare time on tech projects.
