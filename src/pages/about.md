Iâ€™m married with a baby girl, and two cats. We live in North-East England.

I grew up in the countryside, which inspired my masters degree in Geoscience. My Digital journey started with networking learnt working in Oil & Gas before moving into Financial Services where I supported Cyber Security engagements.

I moved into a product role in the public sector at the end of 2019 starting in Networking, before moving into Microsoft 365 and now within Platform Engineering and Developer Tooling. I help product teams deliver faster and safer by managing the internal platform - code hosting, continuous integration / continuous delivery (CI/CD), artefact storage and the engineering tools they rely on to build software. The platform is large scale and high leverage, allowing the higher level product teams to focus on solving citizen problems.
