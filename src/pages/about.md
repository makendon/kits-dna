</figure>

Iâ€™m married with a baby girl, and two cats. We live in North-East England.

I grew up in the countryside, which inspired my masters degree in Geoscience. My Digital journey started with networking learnt working in Oil & Gas before moving into Financial Services where I supported Cyber Security engagements.

I moved into a product role in the public sector at the end of 2019 starting in Networking, before moving into Microsoft 365 and now within Platform Engineering and Developer Tooling. Our product/s are *internal* - our users are primarily engineers - and our mission is to improve their lives by providing them the tools they need to allow them to focus on solving citizen problems.
