## :package: My product management philosophy

Foo bar bash

## :package: Internal product management

Being an *internal* product manager is tough, unlike customers who don't know what is possible, our users have an idea about what is possible. Our products are technical, and often 3rd party tools, so having deep knowledge of the product is challenging without engineering experience. Subsequently I spend more time growing my technical skills but this is an investment that will benefit me long term allowing better collaboration and conversations with users and stakeholders.

## :loudspeaker: Public sector

The public sector doesn't make profit or bring in revenue, but presents challenges around what's viable, often with an emphasis on fraud, error and debt.

Value in the public sector isn't if someone would buy or choose to use your product, it's the only product or service that meets a need, there's no competition. Value is provided by **improving the lives of citizens** - access to essential benefits, making it easy to file a tax return, getting a drivers license or passport.
