I’m married with a baby girl, and two cats, one or both might appear on this site at some point! We live in North-East England.

I grew up in the countryside, which inspired my masters degree in Geoscience. My Digital journey started with basic networking learnt while working in Oil & Gas (offshore) before moving into Financial Services where i supported Cyber Security engagements.

I then moved into a product role in Government at the end of 2019 starting in Networking, before moving into Microsoft 365 and now within Platform Engineering and Developer Tooling.

Being an "internal" product manager is hard, and being in Government makes it even more challenging. Governments aren't trying to make a profit or bring in revenue, but `value` isn't defined by £'s or $'s, Governments provide value to citizens by **improving thier lives** - access to essential benefits, making it easy to file a tax return, or one of the many other services Governments provide.
