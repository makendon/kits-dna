# :wave: Aloha, I'm Kit

![Image of me throwing a shaka at the top of Mauna Kea](/assets/images/Me.jpeg)

Iâ€™m married with a baby girl, and two cats, one or both might appear on this site at some point! We live in North-East England.

I grew up in the countryside, which inspired my masters degree in Geoscience. My Digital journey started with networking learnt working in Oil & Gas before moving into Financial Services where i supported Cyber Security engagements.

I moved into a product role in the public sector at the end of 2019 starting in Networking, before moving into Microsoft 365 and now within Platform Engineering and Developer Tooling. Our product/s are *internal* - our users are primarily engineers.

## Internal Product Management

Being an *internal* product manager is tough, unlike customers who don't know what is possible, our users have an idea about what is possible, because they are fellow engineers. Our products are technical, and often 3rd party tools, so having deep knowledge of the product is challenging due to its size, and without engineering experience - i lean more on tech lead than i'd like. A consequence of this is that I spend more time growing my technical skills then a do my product knowledge, but this is an investment that will benefit me long term allowing better collaboration and conversations with the product, users and stakeholders.

## Public Sector

The public sector doesn't make profit or bring in revenue, but presents challenges around what's viable, often with an emphasis on fraud, error and debt.

Value in the public sector isn't if someone would buy or choose to use your product, it's the only product or service that meets a need, there's no competition. Value is provided by **improving the lives of citizens** - access to essential benefits, making it easy to file a tax return, getting a drivers license or passport. Value can also be seen as:

- Experience: User satisfaction.
- Expenditure: Can we save costs / public money.
- Efficiency: Doing more with less, increasing automation, reducing toil.
- Effectiveness: Achieving objectives and policies.
