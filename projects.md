> :memo: **Note:** These are ideas for **personal** projects to develop my technology skills.
  
## :man: Personal Website

For my first *personal* foray into technology, why not start with a personal website. This site is open source, you can view the code at [kits-dna](https://github.com/makendon/kits-dna). The repository name was inspired by [crisp-dna](https://dna.crisp.se/docs/index.html), but is an insight into *my* inner workings rather than a consulting company.

My site is hosted on GitHub Pages and built using **Jekyll**. The theme is **Minima**, with some custom `HTML` and `CSS`. I built the site entirely on my iPad Pro using **GitHub Codespaces**.

I created the homepage image myself by drawing **bikablo** style visuals. I'm terrible at drawing but I'm pleased how well they turned out. The Apple **Freeform** app helped me out by smoothing some lines. Hopefully product people will recognise what the visuals represent. The site logo is AI generated using **DALL.E**.

Check out my [blog]({{ '/blog/' | relative_url }}) for more on building `kits-dna` if you're interested.

Building the site got me started with markup code, and design. Learning a programming language is next up.

## :cat: Scratch

Why not start learning programming like a kid. **Scratch** is an MIT project to help kids get into programming by using a fun graphical approach. Scratch is available online and also comes installed on `Raspberry Pi OS`.

## :snake: Python

Next step is learning a *text* based programming language. I’m planning to follow [Replit’s 100 days of code](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python) course to learn `python`. On day 100 you build a product price scraper. Not sure what product/s I’ll scrape but this course should be a good introduction to programming.

## :gift: Product

Increasing the ambition level a bit now. I’ve got an idea for a *product*. Being a product manager, I want to solve a problem, but I might end up in a product anti-pattern and prototype a solution to a problem that *I* have. This project will combine new found technical skills with my product skills.
