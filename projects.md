> :memo: **Note:** These are all ideas for **personal** projects to help develop my technology skills.
  
## :man: Personal Website

For my first *personal* foray into technology, why not start with a personal website. This site is open source, you can view the code at [kits-dna](https://github.com/makendon/kits-dna). The repository name was inspired by [crisp-dna](https://dna.crisp.se/docs/index.html), but is an insight into *my* inner workings rather than a consulting company.

### :information_source: Quick Info

My site is hosted on GitHub Pages and built using `Jekyll`. The theme is `minima`, with some custom HTML and CSS. I built the site entirely on my iPad Pro using GitHub Codespaces.

I created the homepage image myself by drawing [bikablo](https://bikablo.com/en/home-page/) style visuals. I'm terrible at drawing but I'm pleased how well they turned out! The Apple **Freeform** app helped me out by smoothing some lines. Hopefully product people will recognise what the visuals represent.

I used **Canva** to create my website logo, simple to do using a template, i just changed the colours to my two core site colours which are `british racing green` and `lava`.

Check out my [blog](blog/) for more on building `kits-dna` if you're interested.

Building the site got me started with markup code, and a wee bit of design. Learning a programming language is next up.

## :cat: Scratch Project

On to programming and why not learn like a kid! Scratch is an MIT project to help kids get into programming by using a fun graphical approach.

## :pound: Price Scraper

I’m planning to follow [Replit’s 100 days of code](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python) to learn `python`. On day 100 you build a product price scraper. Not sure what product/s i’ll scrape but this project should be a good introduction programming.

## :detective: Unknown Product

Increasing the ambition level a bit now! I’ve got an idea for a **product** , being a product manager, i want to solve a problem, but i might end up in a product anti-pattern and prototype a solution to a problem *i* have, therefore blurring into bespoke solution territory.
