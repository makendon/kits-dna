> :memo: **Note:** These are all ideas for personal projects to help develop my technology skills. None of these ideas relate to work.
  
## :man: Personal Website

This website is my first personal foray into technology, and why not start with a personal website. This website is open source, you can view the code at [“kits-dna”](https://github.com/makendon/kits-dna). The name and site to a degree was inspired by [“crisp-dna”](https://dna.crisp.se/docs/index.html), but is an insight into *my* inner workings rather than a consulting company.

### Themes

My site is based on the `minima` Jekyll theme, with some custom HTML and CSS. I built the site entirely on my iPad Pro using GitHub codespaces. I’ll add some blog posts about my experience of building the site.

The main text colour is "British Racing Green" and the link colour is "Lava". My goal is to keep the site clean, i have played with a logo but haven't got it right yet.

### Next

Building the site got me started with markup code, and design. Learning a programming language is next up.

## :cat: Scratch Project

On to programming and why not learn like a kid! Scratch is an MIT project to help kids get into programming by using a fun graphical approach.

## :pound: Price Scraper

I’m planning to follow ["Replit’s 100 days of code"](https://replit.com/learn/100-days-of-python). On day 100 you build a product price scraper using `python`. Not sure what products i’ll scrape but this project will hopefully get me started in programming.

## :detective: Unknown Product

Increasing the ambition level a bit here! I’ve got an idea in mind for a `product` , being a product manager, i want to solve a problem, but i might end up in a product anti-pattern and prototype a solution to a problem i have, therefore blurring into *bespoke* solution territory. I’ll validate using discovery testing techniques.
