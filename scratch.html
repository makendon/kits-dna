        <p>I haven't spent loads of time on Scratch but it was quite fun to make up a random story and a quick game.
            The graphical approach does let you see the code and the order in which the instructions are carried out.
            The tutorials and shared projects on the Scratch website make it easy to get some ideas and get started.
