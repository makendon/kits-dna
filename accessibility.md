I want as many people as possible to be able to use this website, however be aware that parts will not be fully accessible.

No accessibility *testing* except the checks below have been conducted. If the websites accessibility can be improved please [contact me]({{ "/contact/" | relative_url }}) or open an issue on [kits-dna](https://github.com/makendon/kits-dna/issues).

The following steps have been taken to make this website accessible:

## Images

- All images have alt text

## Emoji

- This site uses jemoji, a GitHub flavoured emoji plugin for jekyll. Emojis have built in alt text

## Colour

- Colour and link contrast checked using [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/) resources (WCAG AAA)
  - Colour Contrast Checker
  - Link Contrast Checker

## Dark Mode

This website is configured for auto dark mode based on your device/browser settings. If you want to change between light or dark mode please change your settings.

> :memo: **Note:** Making the homepage image background transparent has impacted the quality of the image which is best seen in light mode.
